# Internal Diffusers

## Features

- [x] Disable load checkpoints, config and datasets from huggingface which requires proxy_on.
- [x] Support load & save checkpoints on ceph.
  

```
# Test for load & save on ceph.
from diffusers import ControlNetModel
# load checkpoint
controlnet_path = "ours:s3://sdxl_checkpoints/0720_controlnet_test/"
controlnet = ControlNetModel.from_pretrained(controlnet_path, 
                                             use_safetensors=False)

# save checkpoint
save_path = "ours:s3://sdxl_checkpoints/0720_controlnet_test_save"
controlnet.save_pretrained(save_path)
print("Success.")
```

## Installation
```
git clone https://gitlab.pjlab.org.cn/lishikai/diffusers.git
git checkout internal (feat/sd-xl-controlnet-2)
python setup develop

# To load data from Ceph, please ensure that your proxy is turned off 
# and set the necessary environment variables as follows:
export HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE=/nvme/shared_huggingface_cache/hub
export HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1
```

## Original README

ðŸ¤— Diffusers is the go-to library for state-of-the-art pretrained diffusion models for generating images, audio, and even 3D structures of molecules. Whether you're looking for a simple inference solution or training your own diffusion models, ðŸ¤— Diffusers is a modular toolbox that supports both. Our library is designed with a focus on [usability over performance](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/philosophy#usability-over-performance), [simple over easy](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/philosophy#simple-over-easy), and [customizability over abstractions](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/philosophy#tweakable-contributorfriendly-over-abstraction).

ðŸ¤— Diffusers offers three core components:

- State-of-the-art [diffusion pipelines](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/overview) that can be run in inference with just a few lines of code.
- Interchangeable noise [schedulers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/schedulers/overview) for different diffusion speeds and output quality.
- Pretrained [models](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/models) that can be used as building blocks, and combined with schedulers, for creating your own end-to-end diffusion systems.

## Quickstart

Generating outputs is super easy with ðŸ¤— Diffusers. To generate an image from text, use the `from_pretrained` method to load any pretrained diffusion model (browse the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?library=diffusers&sort=downloads) for 4000+ checkpoints):

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

pipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipeline.to("cuda")
pipeline("An image of a squirrel in Picasso style").images[0]
```

You can also dig into the models and schedulers toolbox to build your own diffusion system:

```python
from diffusers import DDPMScheduler, UNet2DModel
from PIL import Image
import torch
import numpy as np

scheduler = DDPMScheduler.from_pretrained("google/ddpm-cat-256")
model = UNet2DModel.from_pretrained("google/ddpm-cat-256").to("cuda")
scheduler.set_timesteps(50)

sample_size = model.config.sample_size
noise = torch.randn((1, 3, sample_size, sample_size)).to("cuda")
input = noise

for t in scheduler.timesteps:
    with torch.no_grad():
        noisy_residual = model(input, t).sample
        prev_noisy_sample = scheduler.step(noisy_residual, t, input).prev_sample
        input = prev_noisy_sample

image = (input / 2 + 0.5).clamp(0, 1)
image = image.cpu().permute(0, 2, 3, 1).numpy()[0]
image = Image.fromarray((image * 255).round().astype("uint8"))
image
```

## Credits

This library concretizes previous work by many different authors and would not have been possible without their great research and implementations. We'd like to thank, in particular, the following implementations which have helped us in our development and without which the API could not have been as polished today:

- @CompVis' latent diffusion models library, available [here](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion)
- @hojonathanho original DDPM implementation, available [here](https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion) as well as the extremely useful translation into PyTorch by @pesser, available [here](https://github.com/pesser/pytorch_diffusion)
- @ermongroup's DDIM implementation, available [here](https://github.com/ermongroup/ddim)
- @yang-song's Score-VE and Score-VP implementations, available [here](https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch)

We also want to thank @heejkoo for the very helpful overview of papers, code and resources on diffusion models, available [here](https://github.com/heejkoo/Awesome-Diffusion-Models) as well as @crowsonkb and @rromb for useful discussions and insights.
