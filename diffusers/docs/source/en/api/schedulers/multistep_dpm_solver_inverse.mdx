# Inverse Multistep DPM-Solver (DPMSolverMultistepInverse)

## Overview

This scheduler is the inverted scheduler of [DPM-Solver: A Fast ODE Solver for Diffusion Probabilistic Model Sampling in Around 10 Steps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00927) and [DPM-Solver++: Fast Solver for Guided Sampling of Diffusion Probabilistic Models
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01095) by Cheng Lu, Yuhao Zhou, Fan Bao, Jianfei Chen, Chongxuan Li, and Jun Zhu.
The implementation is mostly based on the DDIM inversion definition of [Null-text Inversion for Editing Real Images using Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09794.pdf) and the ad-hoc notebook implementation for DiffEdit latent inversion [here](https://github.com/Xiang-cd/DiffEdit-stable-diffusion/blob/main/diffedit.ipynb).
