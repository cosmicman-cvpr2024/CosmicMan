# Loaders

Adapters (textual inversion, LoRA, hypernetworks) allow you to modify a diffusion model to generate images in a specific style without training or finetuning the entire model. The adapter weights are typically only a tiny fraction of the pretrained model's which making them very portable. ðŸ¤— Diffusers provides an easy-to-use `LoaderMixin` API to load adapter weights.

<Tip warning={true}>

ðŸ§ª The `LoaderMixins` are highly experimental and prone to future changes. To use private or [gated](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-gated#gated-models) models, log-in with `huggingface-cli login`.
